<p style="font-family:Arial Narrow"> Are you tired of watching YouTube videos and reading self-help books to boost your focus, motivation, and productivity? Then you've probably heard the same tips over and over again. "Sleep, eat healthy, stop procrastinating, take a nap" ...We've heard it all before. Here are some more efficient ways to <i> <b> actually </b> </i> be more productive. </p>








<h2 style="font-family:Calibri; color:#21618C; text-align:center; background-color:#AED6F1"> Habit Building </h2>

<h3 style="font-family:monospace"> 1.) Pair a new habit with an existing habit. </h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial Narrow"> If you pair a new habit with a habit you already do on a regular basis, it will be much easier to complete. Your brain then does not need to build a new habit completely from scratch. It merely needs to build an association with the old habit.</p>


<h3 style="font-family:monospace"> 2.) Associate habits with specific places. </h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial Narrow"> People tend to associate activities with places. If you dedicate areas to specific habits, you will be more likely to carry them out. For example, it would be wise to associate your office only with work. </p>


<h3 style="font-family:monospace"> 3.) Make good habit easier to do and bad habits harder to do. </h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial Narrow"> If a habit requires a lot of time or energy, you will be less likely to do it. Put things associated with good habits in places that are easy to access, such as setting vitamins on your nightstand to take when you wake up. Similarly, when you are trying to get work done, place your phone in another room. </p>


<h3 style="font-family:monospace"> 4.) Set reminders. </h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial Narrow"> People are more forgetful than they realize. Also, it takes a long time for a habit to become automatic. Make your habit a notification, a sticky note, or something else that will remind you to complete the habit. </p>












<h2 style="font-family:Calibri; color:#D81B60; text-align:center; background-color:#F8BBD0"> Setting Goals </h2>

<h3 style="font-family:monospace"> 1.) Set several due dates. </h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial Narrow"> If you are a procrastinator, you are very fond of the laser focus you get right before a due date. However, this isn't always the best idea. If you set several due dates, you will have more consistent progress. For example, if a paper is due in a month, don't just set a due date for the paper. Set due dates for when you want to draft, write the first half of it, write the second half of it, edit, and proofread. This way, even if you do things at the last minute before the due dates you set, you are far better off than writing the entire paper the night before. </p>



<h3 style="font-family:monospace"> 2.) Set milestones. </h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial Narrow"> Big goals can seem impossible, unmanageable, or too ambitious. This can cause a person to feel overwhelmed to even discouraged from trying. However, setting milestones can help a person to acknowledge the progress they are making towards a big goal. For example, if a person wants to lose 50 pounds, they should set a milestone to congratulate themself after every 5 or 10 pounds. </p>


<h3 style="font-family:monospace"> 3.) Make your goals public. </h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial Narrow"> Accountability is a great motivator to following through with goals. Whether you tell friends about it or have a social media account for it, make sure you cannot silently fail at your goal. </p>


<h3 style="font-family:monospace"> 4.) Be specific with your goals. </h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial Narrow"> Think back to last New Year's. You may have written some goals like "be healthier," but what exactly does that mean? When thinking about goals, you need to be specific. This allows you to create an action plan to achieve them. A more precise goal would be something like "limit takeout food to once a month." </p>







<h2 style="font-family:Calibri; color:#FDD835; text-align:center; background-color:#FFF9C4"> Motivation </h2>

<h3 style="font-family:monospace"> 1.) Bore yourself into being productive. </h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial Narrow"> Boredom is a great motivator. For instance, if you have chores to do but routinely can't stop scrolling through social media, set a timer on your phone to lock you out of the app after an allotted time. Get away from whatever is distracting you. Power off your phone or turn off the television. Eventually, you will be so bored that you would rather do the laundry than do nothing. </p>


<h3 style="font-family:monospace"> 2.) Watch someone else being productive or collaborate. </h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial Narrow"> Other people's actions influence our own. If everyone else in your house is cleaning, you are more likely to clean as well. Collaborate on productive tasks. Or, watch others who are doing what you want to do. You can watch YouTubers cleaning their house, go to a study hall where other students are studying, and so on. </p>


<h3 style="font-family:monospace"> 3.) Force yourself to work for just five minutes. </h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial Narrow"> Getting started is often the hardest part of any task. Force yourself to do the task for just five minutes. Usually, you will find that you want to continue, as the task wasn't as daunting as it seemed. But if you don't want to continue, at least you worked on it for five minutes. </p>


<h3 style="font-family:monospace"> 4.) Give yourself the option of not doing the task. </h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial Narrow"> Allow yourself to do the task, or do something else. For example, if you have to drop off a package, give yourself another option, such as doing a seven-minute high-intensity workout. This way, you are doing something good with either option you pick, but hopefully, it will motivate you to do the task you need to accomplish. </p>
